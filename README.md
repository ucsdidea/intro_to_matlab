# UCSD IDEA: Intro to Matlab
Files for the Intro to Matlab workshops, presented by the IDEA Student Center of UC San Diego.

## Requirements
- Matlab

## Installation
Beginning this year (2016), MathWorks provides free student Matlab licenses to all UC San Diego students. To install Matlab:

1. go to the Matlab license site: https://matlab.ucsd.edu/student.html
2. follow the "Get Access" instructions:
    1. create a MathWorks account with your @ucsd.edu email address
    2. download and install Matlab on your laptop

**NOTE:** the installer file is large (~5 GB) and the final Matlab program (with all toolboxes) is even larger (~15 GB). You can skip the toolboxes (to save space), but the installation will still take ~15â€“30 minutes.

### Matlab Online
If you are unable to install Matlab on your computer, MathWorks now offers Matlab Online, a service for running Matlab through your web-browser. By signing up for a MathWorks account (using your @ucsd.edu email address), you are granted access to Matlab Online:

1. go to the Matlab Online login page: https://matlab.mathworks.com/
2. log in with your MathWorks account


## Topics covered
- basic math operations
- variables
- math functions
- loops
- plotting

## Online demos
Although Matlab is very useful, let's also look at a few other demos for things you can accomplish using programming:
- [Cat detector](https://harthur.github.io/kittydar/)
- [How old do I look?](https://how-old.net/)
- [Park or bird?](http://parkorbird.flickr.com/) (inspired by [XKCD #1425](https://xkcd.com/1425/))
- [Image classification](http://demo.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Math visualization](https://maxbittker.github.io/Mojulo/)
- [Interactive visuals](http://www.redblobgames.com/)
- [Fluid Dynamics simulation](https://nerget.com/fluidSim/)
